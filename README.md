          }
          ```

### List Page

5. [x]: Clicking on the pencil icon changes the item into an edit state.
6. [x]: Clicking on the trash icon removes the item from the list.
7. [x]: Typing something in the search bar filters the list, case insensitive.
8. [x]: The list can have an unlimited number of entries.
9. [x]: There is no special empty state. An empty list is fine.
10. [x]: Persist the data between sessions (local storage is fine).
11. [x]: A logout button exists on the top right. Clicking the logout button will log the user out and
return him or her to the login screen.


### Note

The Form Submission for the provided endpoint produced CORS errors, and it seems that
no matter what solution I tried I was seeing `preflight` issues. Tried extensions for both Mozilla and Chrome. Digging deeper into the I noticed the connection was closed.
